	<h1>Manifesto</h1>
	<p>Western Aero Design is a team run by students, with the goal of expanding one’s skillset and building meaningful connections during our time at Western. Each year, we design, test, and construct aircrafts for use in international competitions, where our collective abilities are put to the test. Our fleet consists of radio controlled airplanes, a quadcopter, and a hexacopter is being constructed and experimented with. We leverage skillsets and technologies from many fields in order to make further advancements year after year, enabling us to reach new heights.</p>

	<p>Our team is mostly comprised of people from various engineering streams, as well as non-engineers with programming skills. We leverage CAD, computational fluid dynamics, and electronics design to achieve our goals. Not sure if we’re a right fit for you? Not a problem! There are many other ways to contribute. Contact us!</p>

	<ul style="text-align: justify;">
		<li>
			<strong>Advanced Class</strong>: Design a plane to carry as much weight as possible while carrying Medicare packages to be delivered to a target. This class requires real time telemetry tracking of the plane from a ground station to coordinate the release of the payloads from a ground station and ensure the package is delivered on target.</li><li>
			<strong>Micro Class</strong>: Design a plane to carry as much weight as possible that can break down to fit in the smallest container possible. One catch - has to be able to be assembled in under 3 minutes!
		</li>
	</ul>

	<a href="https://unmannedsystems.ca/home/students/student-competition-details/ ">Unmanned Systems Canada Competition</a> (USCC)
	<p>This competition requires the development of a UAV to assist farmers with assessing crop health using remote soil sampling probes, image recognition, and full spectrum analysis of their crops. Within a one hour time frame, each team must fly and assess the field from which a report is generated and submitted to the judges for marking. </p>
